# viptv development

Delivery policy (owner approved 2026-09-27): only Android, desktop, Roku and TV-web
build workflows remain, triggered by main pushes and manual dispatch. No PR
gates, automatic releases, image publishing or deployment. Retain local checks.
This supersedes older automation/release-gate instructions below.

Before changing product behavior, read the pinned design revision in DESIGN_REF and https://github.com/viptv-org/design/blob/main/DESIGN.md, then its relevant visual and behavior specifications. Record proposed UX changes in design first; link the approved design commit and acceptance scenarios in the implementation issue. Match tap, hold, Back, focus restoration, and error behavior across platforms.

The public `/device` code-entry page follows the newer VIPTV design system. Its
separate revision and generated variables are locked in
`design-contract/link-tv/lock.json`. Account/admin screens now follow the
approved ADM-002 design at `DESIGN_REF`; preserve the independent Link TV lock.

Specs and tickets live in this repository's GitHub Issues. Search existing issues first; use needs-triage, needs-info, ready-for-agent, ready-for-human, and wontfix. Work from SPEC.md and the issue; validate the affected interface using repository CI commands. Report actual results separately from hardware or deployment checks that were not run.

Keep credentials and user data private. Preserve profile/account IDs, configuration and history. Production migration retains the existing environment and named volume viptv_viptv_data; never use docker compose down -v. Use a new artifact path for each build. App assets are versioned in design/assets; local packaged copies remain pinned and updates require an explicit design change.
